SpecFlow-RestSharp-Reqres-API-Testing

This project demonstrates API testing using SpecFlow and RestSharp with the Reqres API.

Description
This project aims to showcase the implementation of API testing using SpecFlow, a behavior-driven development (BDD) framework, and RestSharp, a popular REST and HTTP API client library for .NET. The testing scenarios are designed to interact with the Reqres API (https://reqres.in/), a mock API for testing and prototyping.

Features
. SpecFlow Scenarios: Utilizes SpecFlow to write test scenarios in Gherkin syntax, allowing for clear and readable feature files.
. RestSharp Integration: Integrates RestSharp library to perform HTTP requests and assertions against the Reqres API endpoints.
. Test Automation: Demonstrates the automation of API tests for verifying various functionalities of the Reqres API.
